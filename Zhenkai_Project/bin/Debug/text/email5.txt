Email Message:
Dear Hiring Manager,
I would like to express my deep interest in a position as editorial assistant for your publishing company.
As a recent graduate with writing, editing, and administrative experience, I believe I am a strong candidate for a position at the 123 Publishing Company.

You specify that you are looking for someone with strong writing skills. As an English major at XYZ University, a writing tutor, and an editorial intern for both a government magazine and a college marketing office, I have become a skilled writer with a variety of publication experience.
My maturity, practical experience, attention to detail, and eagerness to enter the publishing business will make me an excellent editorial assistant. I would love to begin my career with your company and am confident that I would be a beneficial addition to the 123 Publishing Company.
I have attached my resume to this email and will call within the next week to see if we might arrange a time to speak together.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Jane Jones
