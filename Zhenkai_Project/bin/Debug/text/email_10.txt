I highly recommend Michelle Johnson as a candidate for the position of fifth-grade lead teacher at your school. As principal of St. Paul's School, I have had the pleasure of working with Michelle for the past five years. She is a driven, organized teacher who develops inspiring relationships with her students.
Michelle has always been driven to develop her skills as a teacher. She came to us a student teacher, eagerly taking up extra responsibilities such as advisor of the school newspaper and was a member of our curriculum committee. She continued to demonstrate this drive through her tenure at our school, even becoming the head of the curriculum committee last year. Michelle embraces any opportunity for professional development, which makes her an ideal leader.
Michelle has a wonderful rapport with people of all ages, especially children. Her ability to connect with her students and her talent at teaching simple concepts, as well as more advanced topics, are both truly superior. She also has excellent written and verbal communication skills with both parents and teachers.
Michelle accomplishes all these tasks with great initiative and with a positive attitude.
I recommend Michelle to you without reservation. If you have any further questions with regard to her background or qualifications, please do not hesitate to contact me.
