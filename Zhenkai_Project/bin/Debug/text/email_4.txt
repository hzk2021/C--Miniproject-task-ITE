"Hello.
I do not presume to judge you, but as a result of few cases, we have point of contact since now. I do not think that caress oneself is very bad, but when all your acquaintances see it- its obviously bad. 
So, closer to the point. You visited the internet with ??rn, which I’ve seized with the deleterious soft. Then you chose video, virus started working and your device became working as dedicated desktop at once. Naturally, all cams and screen started recording instantly and then my soft collected all contacts from your device.
I message you on this e-mail address, because I’ve collected it with my soft, and I guess you for sure check this work address.
The most important thing that I edited video, on one side it shows your screen record, on second your cams record. Its very amusingly. But it was sophisticated .
All in all- if you want me to delete all this compromising evidence, here is my Bitcoin wallet address- 1sdVjarp83LgB8ogxPg3ZavURd8tE36Mo (it must be without «spaces» or «=aquo;,check it). If you do not know how to use it, you can ask google or youtube for tips- its very easy. I suggest, that 310 usd will finish your problem and will destroy our touchpoint . You have one day after reading this message(I put special pixel in it, ill know when you read it). If you wont pay me, ill share the compromising with all contacts I’ve collected from you.
Finally, you can ask police for help, but, obviously, they will not find me for 1 day, so you will be shamed at all. Sorry for misprints, I am foreign. "
Had to read thru this twice to understand what the fck was going on.
