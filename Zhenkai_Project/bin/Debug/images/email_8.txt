Hi, i guess you’re wondering why you’re receiving this email right?
It would be highly beneficial to your privacy if you didn’t ignore it.
I have placed a Marlware on an adult website (…P…0…r…n site) and as you visited and watched the video your device has been affected, placing a spyware on your machine. Which has recorded you both with webcam and screen capture while you had your “funTime” allowing me to see exactly what you see.
This has also affected your smartphone via an expl0it. So do not think for one minute you can circumvent this by reinstalling your OS. You have already been recorded.
After that my malvware collected all your messengers, emails and social networks contacts.
I guess this isn’t good news right?
But don’t worry too much, there’s a way we can fix this privacy issue. All i require is a Bitcoin payment of 150 USD which i think is a fair price considering the circumstances.
The address to make the payment is: 1FGX3VjWNpc1CK33884cftMWuq7sJjCJGw
If you don’t understand bitcoin, go on youtube and search for “how to buy bitcoin” or google for “localbitcoins”, its pretty easy to do it.

You have only 48 hours after reading this e-mail to send payment (Be warned i know when you have opened and read this email, i have placed a pixel image inside it. Which enables me to know when you have opened the messaged on exactly what day and time)?
If you decide to ignore this email, i will have no choice but to forward the video to all the collected contacts you have on your email account, aswell as post on your social media accounts (facebook etc) + send as a personal message to all FB contacts. and of course make the video publicly available on internet, via youtube and adult websites. And considering the current christmas period, i highly doubt you want to be exposed to your family/friends/coworkers during december.
If i receive payment all the material will be destroyed and you will never hear from me again.
If you dont believe and want proof just reply to this email with “PROOF” and i will send your video to 3 of your contacts via email, and post on your facebook wall. In which you will be able to remove it once, not forever
