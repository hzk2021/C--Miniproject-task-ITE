Hi, how are you today?
Im afraid you dont know me but thats not the point of this email, i am
contacting you regarding an urgent issue that requires your immediate
attention
I am a member of Elite Black Group and we setup a very aggressive malvware
inside a porn website with adult videos
You accesed the website to watch videos and have some fun (you know what i
mean, no problem with that, you have a good taste, lol)
While you were watching the video our virus started to work and setup your
computer as a Remote Desktop. When this happened i had full control of your
computer screen and your camera (yes i could see what you were watching
along with your face and actions by your cam).
We also collected all your contacts from Messengers, Social Networks,
Emails.
So what i did next? Well, i started to record an live double-screen video
(first part your screen sharing, second part your camera while watching
porn)
You dont need to freak out, there is an easy way to fix all this mess and
you will not have your privacy exposed:
All you have to do is pay me U$450 i think this is a fair value to keep
our little secret safe.
You will make this payment by Bitcoin (if you dont know what is Bitcoin or
how to use it, just search “How to buy bitcoin” on internet, its easy).
The wallet address you will send the money to is:
1FqHTugquxNZ8cHdm9LqPYvSrzuaatkRXs
You have only 24h from the time you read this email to make my payment
(i setup a tracking pixel in this message and i will know when you read it).
If i dont receive my Bitcoins i will send your video to all contacts that
i collected from you.
If i receive my money all the evidence will be destroyed and you will
never hear from me again.
Now its up to you, will you be smart enough or the joke of your family and
friends forever?
